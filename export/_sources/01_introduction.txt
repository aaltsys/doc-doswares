DOS WARES Export Mapper
#############################

DOS WARES is capable of writing flat-file and structured exports of individual 
transaction records, selected database cursors, and entire tables (files).

From menu selection :menuselection:`eXchange --> Export-Import --> Exports`, 
export maps may be defined to write masterfile and transaction text data in 
specialized formats, such as

*  JSON structured documents (.JSN).
*  QUICKBOOKS import format (.IIF).

Executing an Export
=============================

Export maps define both the structure of the exported data and the method for 
naming and locating the exported files. Demand exports are executed through the 
:program:`EXPORTDATA` command, which is usually managed through either a 
control record for either a :program:`PROCESS` or a :program:`REPORT`.

WARES posting controls can generate transaction exports using database triggers. 
This alternative to demand exports will create export files from database 
activity without user interaction.

Database Trigger Exports
=============================

A new export program has been added to be called from the file posting controls. 
Program :program:`POST_EXPORTDATA` uses the data mapper and definition records 
as previously mentioned, but will perform exports automatically based on file 
system actions. Implement an automatic transaction export as follows.

#. At :menuselection:`Tools --> Define --> Controls` enter a control 
   :guilabel:`Type` of :kbd:`POST` and enter a WARES filename such as 
   :file:`SHIPMENTS` in the :guilabel:`Identifier`. The current posting 
   control will display.
#. Select a location for the export call, and press :kbd:`<Ctrl-N>` to enter a 
   new line. Use the program name :program:`POST_EXPORTDATA`, and an export
   control identifier in the :guilabel:`Branch` column. 
#. Fill in the :guilabel:`Test`, :guilabel:`Value`, and :guilabel:`Occur` 
   entries to determine the rule or condition which will trigger the export.
   For example, *Test=GT*, *Value=1*, *Occur=Always* will write posted 
   transactions and update the exported file with each change.
