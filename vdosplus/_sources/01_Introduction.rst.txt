WARES Execution Alternatives
#############################

The move to 64-bit Windows 7 or later eliminates running :program:`WARES` natively 
on a Windows operating system. There are other options, however. These include:

*  DOS emulation using :program:`vDosPlus` on Windows 7 or later
*  :program:`VmWare` or similar virtual machine execution of DOS/WARES 
*  Microsoft's :program:`Virtual Windows XP` emulation (32-bit Windows only)
*  Remote desktop access to :program:`WARES` on an ADDS Server (32-bit Windows only)
*  Linux Ubuntu desktop operating system, and :program:`DOSEMU`

Of these options, the easiest and most effective solution is the first one, 
:program:`VDosPlus`.

vDosPlus Emulation Program
=============================

:program:`VDosPlus` addresses the following concerns with running DOS 
applications today:

*  DOS programs cannot run on 64-bit Windows systems
*  DOS uses Windows Short File Names (SFN) and not Long File Names (LFN)
*  DOS does not print directly to Windows printers
*  DOS characters do not scale, the resulting display may be illegible
*  Programs requiring EMS memory (e.g., :program:`WARES`) may not work
*  NETBIOS networking (SMBv1) is deprecated and may not work

In this brief tutorial, you will learn how to use :program:`vDosPlus` to fix two 
of the problems listed above: running :program:`WARES` on :program:`vDosPlus` and
printing directly to Windows printers from :program:`WARES` using :program:`vDosPlus`. 

:program:`vDosPlus` is an emulation, and therefore it runs more slowly than 
native DOS would. However, the benefits of :program:`vDosPlus` far outweigh the 
performance cost when using :program:`WARES`.

.. Note::
   :program:`vDosPlus` is freeware, but its developers would appreciate any 
   donation you would make when registering the program.
