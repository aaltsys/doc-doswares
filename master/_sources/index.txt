DOS WARES Site Index
=============================

Configuration
-----------------------------

Numerous WARES configuration issues result from Microsoft's negligent handling 
of DOS execution under Windows. Some of these topics are addressed here: 

:ref:`configure:index`.

Support Documents
-----------------------------

Specific WARES problems are addressed at :ref:`support:index`.

Data Export Mapping
-----------------------------

The export mapper at :menuselection:`eXchange --> Export/import --> Exports` 
can define flat-file and structured text exports of WARES data records. WARES
can export individual records, selected groups, or entire files (tables), and 
exports may be batched, or be selected during printing, or be triggered when
transactions are saved. The Export Mapper can write JSON documents to interface 
DOSWARES with web applications. 

For details, see :ref:`exports:index`.
