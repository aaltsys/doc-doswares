DOS WARES Site Index
=============================

vDosPlus Alternative to DOS
-----------------------------

Due to Microsoft's negligence, Windows has many barriers to executing DOS 
programs such as WARES. Many developers have worked on these problems, and as a 
result there is now an excellent tool for addressing Windows/DOS issues:

:ref:`vDosPlus`.

Configuration
-----------------------------

Where WARES is running in a 32-bit Windows environment with only one or two 
configuration issues, some of these topics are addressed here: 

:ref:`configure:index`.

Support Documents
-----------------------------

Specific WARES problems are addressed at :ref:`support:index`.

Data Export Mapping
-----------------------------

The export mapper at :menuselection:`eXchange --> Export/import --> Exports` 
can define flat-file and structured text exports of WARES data records. WARES
can export individual records, selected groups, or entire files (tables), and 
exports may be batched, or be selected during printing, or be triggered when
transactions are saved. The Export Mapper can write JSON documents to interface 
DOSWARES with web applications. 

For details, see :ref:`export:index`.

JSON Orders Import 
-----------------------------

Part of export development has produced a JSON orders import for orders 
exchange with accounts. Implementation details are at :ref:`JSON-import`.

Resources
-----------------------------

:ref:`resources:downloads`

This page consolidates the various DOS support files for WARES, including:

+  Batch execution files
+  Program patch updates
+  A demo copy of WARES Warehousing
+  EDI standards table data

+  :ref:`resources:upd-450e`
